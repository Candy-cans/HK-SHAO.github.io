Today I want to talk about how to get a boyfriend. If any boy is here also wants to get a boyfriend, you can come and listen to my speech too. But if you are gay（不加冠词a是西方的惯法）, I can understand. In addition, for those beautiful girls who already have a boyfriend, I can teach you have more boyfriends. Okay, let's get to the point!

First of all, you need to meet a boy. I know you all want to meet a handsome, funny, smart and kind boy. Cai Xukun or Wang Junkai? No, don't daydream! It's your desire, not your dream. You need to have a dream. Like me. I'm your dream, right? A very nice boy. If you want to have a boy friend like that, even though it's your pleasure, please don't disturb me. But you say you love the ClassGrass（Not the grass in the class, but the most handsome boy in the class） in the class next door. It doesn't matter for me. Beacuse if I were your father, I would say "Daughter! You've finally grown up, like a woman!"

Okay, let's speed up a little bit. After you find the right person, get to know him a bit. For example, how is his academic performances? Will he teach you how to do math exercies? Does he have a lot of money at home? Can he play basketball well? It should be noted here that you don't need to know that Cai Xukun can play basketball well. 

Developing Your Friendship. No way. You will be caught by Liu Shan and go home to reflect.

Making Him Fall for You. No way. You are ugly and fierce like a tiger. No boy will fall in love with you.

Making a Move. No way. Liu Shan is coming!

Making Connections in the Future. Oh, My God! How many babies do you want to have?

Okay, that's all I have to say. If you have any questions, you can ask me now. No? Thank you, my speech is over.
